						Hello, my name is Ritika Bhagya and I was born in Pune, India. I am a Product Design graduate (2007-2011) from Symbiosis Institute of Design, Pune, India. I have worked as a Design Researcher and a User Experience Designer before I came to New York to pursue an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons The New School for Design. I am currently in my final thesis year [2nd year] of the MFA D+T program.<br><br>

						I have always been interested in working and learning from various areas of design. I have a strong inclination towards user experience and visual design and believe in making things that are easy to use and look aesthetically appealing. Designing for usability, interaction design and critical thinking are some of my strengths. <br><br>

						I have lived in India for 22 years and moved to New York City a year back. I look forward to explore and travel the world. I would love to take the knowledge I learn from this city and Parsons back to my country to be able to successfully make a mark as an entrepreneur and an educator. <br><br>
